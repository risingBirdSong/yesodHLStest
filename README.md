# yesodFromScratch

I tried I several of the Yesod templates and none of them worked with HLS which isn't great. 
I tried making a new project using ``stack new yesodFromScratch`` and then copy pasting in the relevant Yesod stuff into the project to see if HLS was working. And so far yes it is :) 

I have no idea why, but maybe a bug with the Yesod Template?

Of course this project is extremely simple and it may break when I start using it for my personal project, hopefully it just keeps working.
